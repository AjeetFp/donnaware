<B><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2><P>The &quot;zPhone Project&quot;:</B> </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2>The purpose of the &quot;zPhone Project&quot; is to create a hand held Ultra-Thin Client device operating over a wireless connection such as WiFi or 3G/4G high speed wireless. An Ultra-Thin Client (UTC) is a client implemented in hardware. A thin client has no intelligence or computing power of its own and hence, relies completely on it’s server for operation. </P>

<P>The concept of a UTC is to implement the client completely in hardware, specifically an FPGA to reduce the cost and power consumption of the device. A hardware implementation reduces cost since no software licensing, operating system costs or programming costs are incurred for the device itself. </P>

<P>The power consumption is reduced since there is no need for a high speed microprocessor and associated storage, memory and other support peripherals. The end result being that battery life is greatly enhanced. The highest power consumption is incurred from the RF section. For this project, an 802.11b mini-PCMIA interface card is selected. The 802.11b has reduced power consumption over 802.11g/n because b uses a CDMA air interface which has a much lower spectral density than the OFDMA scheme used by g/n.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>FPGA Based Software Defined Radio: </B>An FPGA consists of a large array of Logic Elements (LE). Each LE contains basic building block of digital logic circuits (AND, OR, Flip Flop, etc). These arrays can be in the range of 10K – 100K or more LE’s. Other types of blocks may also be on the FPGA chip such as dedicated multipliers (important for DSP applications) or RAM and sometimes embedded microprocessor (e.g. ARM). All of the blocks can be arbitrarily interconnected to each other via the re-programmable interconnection. The challenge for the designer is to determine the optimal way to interconnect these blocks to achieve the design goal. Many computer aided tools have been developed to assist in this effort. </P>
<P>In this project, an SDR (Software Defined Radio) was simulated and synthesized using Verilog HDL and implemented in a prototype set up. The design demonstrated OFDM modulation scheme to transmit video images and further demonstrated that is software reconfigurable by altering in software to transmit NTSC video over standard broadcast.  This project was used for Masters EE program project.</P>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>The Zero Board Computer: </B></FONT><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>ZBC is a PC-XT SoC (System on a Chip) that is implemented on an Altera Cyclone III FPGA. ZBC is intended to be fun and educational and able to run DOS and uCLinux. The motivation for this project was to emulate the Intel 80186 CPU using Verilog HDL and to synthesis a working computer by utilizing custom and open source (</FONT><A HREF="http://www.opencores.org/"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=1>www.opencores.org</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>) peripheral IP Cores (Intellectual Property) to form a complete bootable SoC. The completed project also implemented complete TCP/IP,UDP,HTTP,FTP,ARP,ICMP stack in a driver called TinySOCK developed by me.</FONT></TD>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Roto-Cell 2000:</B> Roto-Cell is just a fun project that uses </FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3>an old style Rotary Phone with the original internal electronic components removed and replaced with a small cell phone main board and a micro-controller to interface the old style dialer and ringer to the cell phone data interface.   For this project I used an old cell phone that I had laying around and an old timey rotary phone that I bought at a garage sale. The cell phone I used  is an LG VX3300 flip phone.  But you can probably use just about any more recent models.  Most cell phones have a &quot;data Interface&quot; that is basically an RS232 interface that uses the Modem &quot;AT&quot; command set to control it. </FONT></TD>

<B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2><P>Scanning Tunneling Microscope:</B> Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a process by which atoms may be imaged using tunneling theory. STM involves the tunneling of electrons through gap from the tip of the STM to the sample.  This can be considered as tunneling between two metallic electrodes, separated by a vacuum region. The potential in the vacuum region acts as a barrier to electrons. In this simplified form, one can apply the solution of the Schrodinger equation, applied to a rectangular barrier: psi = exp{kx}, where  k = sqrt[2m(Vb - E)/(h2)] where, Vb represents the barrier potential, E is the energy of the particular state, and h corresponds to the reduced Planck constant. In General, the tunneling current through the vacuum is proportional to the separation between the tip and the sample. An atomically sharp tip is used, the tunneling current from the first atom of the tip can be determined while the tip is scanned using piezo-electric nano-positioning probe and the measured tunneling current is numerically processed to an image.</FONT></TD>
