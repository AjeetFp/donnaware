been working on for a long time, it is a complete computer on an FPGA that can be synthisized, 
that is to say, compiled after using a super simple, user friendly GUI to pick all the peripherals
that you want on your SoC. You simply drag and drop the desired resources to your target, compile and download
and you have the perfect chip for you app. You want 16 RS232 ports, 8 PWM ports, whatever combo you need can be
configured specifically for your app. The CPU is the ubiquotous 80186 core, but could be adapted to any. The 
peripherals can be any Wishbone compatible IP cores, e.g. LCD driver, Touchscreen, Mouse, Keyboard, 100BaseT, 
USB Host port, Wifi, 4G wireless, audio driver, PWM, RS232 ports, GPIO lines, SPI interface, system RAM, 
SD card, graphics RAM, etc. (sorry no github files yet, waiting on some legalities).

<b><font size="2"><p>The Modapter:</b> The Modapter is a wireless modem adapter that allows 
you to plug in any USB based wireless modem, 4G, 4G LTE, GSM, GPRS, CDMA and etc. and integrate
that device into your MCU project even if your MCU does not have an OS or any USB drivers.
The Modapter uses the same type of driver as typical Linux boards or Windows based computers
use to interface with Wireless Modems but does not require the user to take on the task of 
installing managing a full blown Linux Operating System. Instead, with Modapter, most of the 
work is done for you, on the Modapter chip, so you can get your project up and on the Mobile 
Internet as quicly as possible without fussing with Linux or other operating systems, drivers 
or complexities.
The Modapter sits between your MCU project and the Wireless Modem and provides a simple interface to send and receive data over the internet.

<b><font size="2"><p>The "zPhone Project":</b> The purpose of the 
      "zPhone Project" is to create a hand held Ultra-Thin Client device 
      operating over a wireless connection such as WiFi or 3G/4G high speed 
      wireless. An Ultra-Thin Client (UTC) is a client implemented in hardware. 
      A thin client has no intelligence or computing power of its own and hence, 
      relies completely on it’s server for operation. </p>
      <p>The concept of a UTC is to implement the client completely in hardware, 
	  specifically an FPGA to reduce the cost and power consumption of the device.
	  A hardware implementation reduces cost since no software licensing, 
	  operating system costs or programming costs are incurred for the device itself. </p>
      <p>The power consumption is reduced since there is no need for a high speed 
	  microprocessor and associated storage, memory and other support peripherals.
	  The end result being that battery life is greatly enhanced. The highest power 
	  consumption is incurred from the RF section. For this project, an 802.11b 
	  mini-PCMIA interface card is selected. The 802.11b has reduced power consumption 
	  over 802.11g/n because b uses a CDMA air interface which has a much lower 
	  spectral density than the OFDMA scheme used by g/n.</p></font>

<b><font size="2"><p>FPGA Based Software Defined Radio: </b>An FPGA 
      consists of a large array of Logic Elements (LE). Each LE contains basic 
      building block of digital logic circuits (AND, OR, Flip Flop, etc). These 
      arrays can be in the range of 10K – 100K or more LE’s. Other types of 
      blocks may also be on the FPGA chip such as dedicated multipliers 
      (important for DSP applications) or RAM and sometimes embedded 
      microprocessor (e.g. ARM). All of the blocks can be arbitrarily 
      interconnected to each other via the re-programmable interconnection. The 
      challenge for the designer is to determine the optimal way to interconnect 
      these blocks to achieve the design goal. Many computer aided tools have 
      been developed to assist in this effort. </p>
      <p>In this project, an SDR (Software Defined Radio) was simulated and synthesized 
	  using Verilog HDL and implemented in a prototype set up. The design demonstrated 
	  OFDM modulation scheme to transmit video images and further demonstrated that is
	  software reconfigurable by altering in software to transmit NTSC video over standard 
	  broadcast.  This project was used for Masters EE program project.</p>

	  <p>The AGC (Apollo Guidance Computer) was a very early computer, designed in 1964, it was 
	  the first to use Integrated Circuits and the first modern embedded processor. When I was 
	  growing up, about 11 years old, I remember the Apollo program was fascinating to me and 
	  I had my eyes glued to the TV for days on end. The Moon landing made such a lasting 
	  impression on me that it is why I decided to go to engineering school and get a degree 
	  in Electrical Engineering. I used an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) that can think 
	  of that as the equivalent of thousands of the TTL chips that is endlessly and completely 
	  reconfigurable.  I used the Altera Cyclone FPGA which has a lot of memory right on the FPGA. 
	  I also developed the user interface using a custom LCD controller using a CLPD and a 
	  Microcontroller with a USB interface so code can be downloaded from your PC.

<b><font size="2"><p>Scanning Tunneling Microscope:</b> Scanning 
      Tunneling Microscopy (STM) is a process by which atoms may be imaged using 
      tunneling theory. STM involves the tunneling of electrons through gap from 
      the tip of the STM to the sample. This can be considered as tunneling 
      between two metallic electrodes, separated by a vacuum region. The 
      potential in the vacuum region acts as a barrier to electrons. In this 
      simplified form, one can apply the solution of the Schrodinger equation, 
      applied to a rectangular barrier: psi = exp{kx}, where k = sqrt[2m(Vb - 
      E)/(h2)] where, Vb represents the barrier potential, E is the energy of 
      the particular state, and h corresponds to the reduced Planck constant. In 
      General, the tunneling current through the vacuum is proportional to the 
      separation between the tip and the sample. An atomically sharp tip is 
      used, the tunneling current from the first atom of the tip can be 
      determined while the tip is scanned using piezo-electric nano-positioning 
      probe and the measured tunneling current is numerically processed to an 
      image.</font></p></td>
